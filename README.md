# Advanced Programming project 2015 (ISCTE-IUL)
GUI Builder is a component that integrates [Pidesco](https://github.com/andre-santos-pt/pidesco), an academic IDE developed in advanced programming subject in Master on Computer Sciences, at [University Institute of Lisbon](http://www.iscte-iul.pt/home.aspx). It allows for an user to build a GUI using a WYSIWYG interface, similar to what is offered by tools such as WindowBuilder.

Further information on the implmementation of extensions to this plugin can be found in the project wiki. Currently this plugin has two extension points, allowing for the creation of new widgets to include in the generated GUI and the add of options in the editor context menu.
